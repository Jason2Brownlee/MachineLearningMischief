# Data Science Dark Side

## Examples of Machine Learning "_Gaming_" or "_Hacking_"

These examples fall into a category often called **scientific gaming** or **research gaming** or simply **machine learning hacking** - they're systematic attempts to exploit evaluation metrics or scientific processes to achieve desired outcomes without actually meeting the underlying scientific objectives.

Below are some examples of some of these deliberate attempts.

I don't know what it is, but writing examples of these attacks feels forbidden and raise a tiny thrill :)

* [Seed Hacking](examples/seed_hacking.md): _Repeat an experiment with different random number seeds to get the best result._
* [Test Set Memorization](examples/test_set_memorization.md): _Allow the model to memorize the test set and get a perfect score._
* [Test Set Overfitting](examples/test_set_overfitting.md): _Optimizing a model for its performance on a "hold out" test set._
* [Leaderboard Hacking](examples/leaderboard_hacking.md): _Issue predictions for a machine learning competition until a perfect score is achieved._
* [p-Hacking](examples/p_hacking.md): _Repeat a statistical hypothesis test until a significant result is achieved._
