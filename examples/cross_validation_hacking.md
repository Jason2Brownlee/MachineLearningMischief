# Cross-Validation Hacking

> Vary the cross-validation folds to get the best result.

Cross-validation hacking involves manipulating the cross-validation process to achieve artificially better results.

Generally, this is a type of seed hacking applied to the selection of train/test folds in k-fold cross-validation.

Here are the main techniques:

1. Seed Hunting
   - Trying hundreds of random seeds for data splitting
   - Reporting only the "best" seed that gives optimal results
   - Example: Running CV 1000 times with different seeds, cherry-picking the one where your model looks best

2. Fold Selection Gaming
   - Manually crafting folds to make validation artificially easy
   - Removing "hard" folds that hurt performance
   - Example: Testing different k values (5-fold, 10-fold, etc.) and only reporting the best one

3. Stratification Manipulation
   - Trying different stratification strategies until finding one that gives better scores
   - Creating complex stratification rules that inadvertently leak information
   - Example: Stratifying on multiple variables until finding a combination that boosts scores

4. Validation Scheme Shopping
   - Switching between different CV schemes (k-fold, leave-one-out, time series CV)
   - Reporting only the scheme that gives best results
   - Example: Trying both group k-fold and standard k-fold, using whichever looks better

5. Data Leakage via CV
   - Performing feature selection/engineering before CV splitting
   - Using test set information to influence fold creation
   - Example: Creating features using statistics from entire dataset before splitting into folds


## Example

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, KFold

# Define the number of trials
num_trials = 100

# Define variables to track the best fold configuration and best performance
best_fold_seed = None
best_performance = -np.inf

# Create a synthetic classification dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=5, n_informative=4, n_redundant=1, random_state=42)

# Initialize the model with a fixed seed
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50, random_state=42)

# Iterate over multiple seeds to vary the k-fold cross-validation splits
for trial in range(num_trials):
    # Set the seed for the k-fold shuffle
    fold_seed = trial

    # Initialize k-fold cross-validation with the current seed
    kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=fold_seed)

    # Evaluate the model using cross-validation
    scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=kf)

    # Calculate the mean performance
    mean_performance = scores.mean()

    # Print the fold seed and performance if there is an improvement
    if mean_performance > best_performance:
        print(f"Fold Seed: {fold_seed}, Performance: {mean_performance:.4f}")
        best_performance = mean_performance
        best_fold_seed = fold_seed

# Report the best fold seed and its performance
print(f"\nBest Fold Seed: {best_fold_seed}, Best Performance: {best_performance:.4f}")

```

Example Output:

```text
Fold Seed: 0, Performance: 0.8000
Fold Seed: 12, Performance: 0.8200
Fold Seed: 56, Performance: 0.8400

Best Fold Seed: 56, Best Performance: 0.8400
```
